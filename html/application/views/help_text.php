<h3>How private/secure is SnapChat?</h3>
<p>SnapChat currently does not use HTTPS, which means anyone watching your network traffic could eavesdrop. In chat, however, users must be joined to send/receive messages. If you see someone you didn't expect in the room, don't say anything, or ask them to leave. Since SnapChat doesn't record any information on the server, they won't be able to see any of the conversation prior to joining.</p>
<br>
<h3>Can I see the source code?</h3>
<p>Sure, it's all up on <a href="https://github.com/scaryuncledevin/SnapChat.org" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<br>
<h3>Why is there no mobile site?</h3>
<p>A design is in progress that will work well on mobile, but there is currently no ETA on that.</p>
<br>
<h3>How does SnapChat work?</h3>
<p>All rooms run in active memory using a queuing system. Once the client requests the queue for the user (which happens twice a second), their queue is purged. Once all users have left the room for good, a cleaning system shuts the room down, purging all remaining data.</p>

<h3>Why don't I need a name?</h3>
<p>Why <em>do</em> you need a name?</p>
<br>
<h3>What other features exist and can I expect?</h3>
